					<h2>The service</h2>
					<p>The Trycode’s website and all the content available through Trycode’s domain name (the “site”) is the property and operated by Trycode.</p>
					<p>Trycode is an online website where customers can access freelance writers who offer high-quality writing services, including essays, dissertations and other forms of writing services. The platform ensures that the writer’s delivery their services to the customers and the customer pay for these services upon meeting the required demands. The website enables the customers to find writers possessing the needed skills, payment range, the duration of the work before completion, and any other relevant information, for instance, content originality.</p>
					<p>The writers are also free to apply for an account with the website since they operate on a freelance basis. The writer must pass internal tests before they are allowed to take orders from the customers through the website. Writers are rated, and those with poor ratings are dropped and banned from using the services to avoid “bad quality products.” It is the prerogative of the support team to ensure that the writer provides high-quality work and if not they may ask the writer to avail additional information on their education, courses or write a trial essay to test their writing skills.</p>
					<p>Customers are free to place their orders by following the order process for a particular job that require the most qualified writer to complete. The writer reads and accepts the terms of the project and commits to completing it within the agreed time and adhering to quality.
